1. The average number of nodes explored or entered (i.e., the number of nodes removed from the frontier)
    * AVERAGE BFS EXPLORED: 10.333333333333334
    * AVERAGE IDLS EXPLORED: 147.88888888888889
    * AVERAGE UCS EXPLORED: 15.88888888888889

    * AVERAGE ASTAR-H EXPLORED: 9.222222222222221

2. The average number of nodes expanded (i.e., the total number of successors)
    * AVERAGE BFS EXPANDED: 35.111111111111114
    * AVERAGE IDLS EXPANDED: 148.77777777777777

    * AVERAGE ASTAR-H MAINTAINED: 14.333333333333334

4. The number of times it found the optimal solution (optimal here is measured as â€œfound the best solution out of the four search algorithms)
    * bfs was optimal 2 times.
    * idls was optimal 3 times.
    * ucs was optimal 6 times.
    * astar_e was optimal 8 times.
    * astar_h was optimal 8 times.
